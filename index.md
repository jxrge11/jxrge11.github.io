## Overview
This repository, **claude-better-responses-mcp**, aims to enhance Claude's coding responses by utilizing a Multi-Agent Communication Protocol (MCP) server. By integrating various AI agents, this project improves the quality and efficiency of coding assistance.

## Features
- **AI Agent Integration**: Seamlessly integrates multiple AI agents for improved responses.
- **OpenAI Compatibility**: Works well with OpenAI models and APIs.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Provides tools for effective prompt design to maximize response quality.
- **Architecture Advisor**: Offers architectural insights for software projects.
- **Developer Tools**: Includes various tools aimed at enhancing developer productivity.
- **Autonomous Agents**: Leverages autonomous agents to provide real-time coding assistance.
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Supports the coordination of multiple agents for complex tasks.

## Installation
To get started, download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/jxrge11/claude-better-responses-mcp/releases). Once downloaded, follow these steps to install:

1. **Extract the files**: Unzip the downloaded file.
2. **Navigate to the directory**: Open your terminal and change to the extracted directory.
3. **Install dependencies**: Run the command:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the server**: Use the following command to launch the MCP server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
After installation, you can start using the MCP server to enhance Claude's coding responses. Here‚Äôs how to do it:

1. **Connect to the Server**: Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000
   ```
   This command will connect you to the MCP server running on your local machine.

2. **Send Requests**: You can send coding queries to the server using a simple HTTP request. For example:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ask -d '{"question": "How do I implement a binary search in Python?"}'
   ```

3. **Receive Responses**: The server will return a JSON response containing the answer from Claude.

### Example
Here‚Äôs a sample interaction with the MCP server:
```bash
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ask -d '{"question": "Explain the difference between a list and a tuple in Python."}'
```
Response:
```json
{
  "response": "A list is mutable, meaning it can be changed, while a tuple is immutable and cannot be altered after creation."
}
```
